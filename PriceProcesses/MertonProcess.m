function [X_t, X_t_AV, t_i] = MertonProcess(sigmaD, muJ, sigmaJ, lambda, T, nTimeSteps, nProcesses, flagAV)
% MERTONPROCESS Simulates paths of a Merton jump-diffusion process.
% This function generates matrices of simulated values from a Merton jump-diffusion
% process, which incorporates both Gaussian diffusion elements and a jump process
% characterized by normally distributed jumps. It optionally supports the use of antithetic variates.
%
% INPUTS:
%   sigmaD       - Volatility of the diffusion part of the stock price.
%   muJ          - Mean of the jump size distribution.
%   sigmaJ       - Standard deviation of the jump size distribution.
%   lambda       - Intensity of the jump process (average number of jumps per unit time).
%   T            - Total time span of the simulation.
%   nTimeSteps   - Number of time steps in the simulation.
%   nProcesses   - Number of independent process paths to simulate.
%   flagAV       - Boolean flag indicating whether to compute antithetic variates (true/false).
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   X_t          - A matrix of size (nProcesses x (nTimeSteps+1)) where each row represents
%                  a simulated path of the Merton model.
%   X_t_AV       - A matrix of the same size as X_t, containing the antithetic paths.
%                  If flagAV is false, this will be returned as an empty matrix.
%   t_i          - A vector of length (nTimeSteps+1) representing the discrete time points
%                  at which the process is evaluated.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   The Merton jump-diffusion model includes both a continuous Gaussian diffusion part
%   and a jump component characterized by a Poisson process with normally distributed jump sizes.
%   This allows modeling assets with occasional large jumps in price in addition to the standard
%   continuous diffusive behavior. The optional antithetic variates feature is used to reduce variance
%   in Monte Carlo simulations.
